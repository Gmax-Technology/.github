## Hi there 👋

Gmax Technology provides products and services to monitor the performance and welfare of horses. We use the latest sensors and wireless technologies to deliver insights into your horse’s performance to maximize competitive advantage and welfare.

Our technology also enables new opportunities for interactive services, to improve the experience of organizers, competitors, owners and fans, and provide new channels for sponsorship and revenue.

The **Gmax Race** system is the most widely deployed thoroughbred race tracking system, providing data used by regulators, broadcasters and racing professionals around the world.

**Gmax VetCheck** is the fastest way to accurately measure a horse's heart rate. It is used by owners and trainers, and by vets responsible for welfare in FEI endurance racing.
